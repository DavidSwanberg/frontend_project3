            <p>Due to covid, many ice cream parlors are not allowing customers in their store. 
                However we have created an online app where customers can place an order for 
                pickup allowing them to enjoy a delicious treat of their choice. We can bring 
                your your morning, mid-day or late night cravings to life. If you have already 
                placed an order you can check your past order by looking for your name and your order will be displayed.
            </p>
